<p>Hi, nice that you could drop by my little place here. So you want to know more about me?</p>
<p>I created my first website when I was 12 years old. An hour after I had received a small book from Telia called "Create Your First Website", I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I grew up. At age 17, I started freelancing and creating websites for friends and acquaintances. Soon the rumor spread and I started getting customers and bigger projects to work with.

Today I am an experienced Front-End developer and love to work with React and Node.js, tools that I used almost in every project. I like to go outside my comfort zone and have worked with techs like Azure, Rest-Api, IoT, and Google Cloud. During my former employment, I rewrote a big part of the UX for the system. I am a social developer/designer (yes, they do exist). During my latest assignment, I was responsible for the communication with the customer building their new React-Native App.

My passion is about development and I appreciate smart solutions. I keep up to date with the latest JavaScript and design techniques. I love working in teams and Scrum but can also take on a project myself. My colleagues would describe me as very happy, driven, and love to share knowledge and experience.</p>

I love the whole idea that you can imagine something and then create it. For me, that is a superpower! I love to work with React and with firebase. I want to thank the team at React for making it so simple to create anything that you want. When it comes to firebase, they sure made development so easy and you can focus on your feature for your app.

I think everybody should learn how to program since they are missing out on so much fun, you become a really good problem solver and you get your black belt in Google-fu fast. Once again, thank you React team and Firebase team for making development fun.

I love to push my limits and show developers what you can do. So I made this [iPad](https://1tg64.csb.app/) with pure css in React(cuz I might want to animate it later). Everything you see(icons, buttons, wi-fi icon, etc) i made with CSS expect for the wallpaper.

The design is as important as the development and you can't do one with the other. I remember when I was 15 and I wanted to make my website look nice. That was when I got into the whole design thing since I didn't know anybody that could help me make my website look good. So I started to look into the design and 20 years later I still look into the design and new inspiration everyday.
